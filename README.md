# SaaS Churn Prediction – Customer Retention Modeling and Dashboard

Predicting which customers will churn (stop using a service) from Telco through EDA, modeling and Power BI dashboards.

Title & One-Sentence Summary

Clear, searchable title (e.g., “SaaS Churn Prediction – Customer Retention Modeling and Dashboard”)

One concise line explaining what the project does and its goal.

Purpose: helps readers instantly grasp the problem space.

💼 2. Business Problem / Context

Describe the real-world situation (not just “predict churn” — but why churn matters for a SaaS business).

Predicting churn enables proactive customer retention, reduces acquisition costs, and improves profitability.
This model helps identify high-risk customers early and guide targeted retention actions.

Mention the decision or action your model supports (e.g., retention strategy, customer targeting).

Customer targeting

Purpose: gives non-technical readers context and stakes.

📊 3. Data Overview

Where the data came from (public dataset, simulated, API, etc.).

The Telco dataset was pulled from Kaggle here. Link

Key stats: number of rows/columns, important variables, any preprocessing needed.

The dataset contained 7,043 unique customers and 21 variables that describe the demographic information, subscription services, and churn of each customer.

Note any limitations or assumptions.

Purpose: shows data awareness and transparency.

⚙️ 4. Methods / Approach

List main steps in your pipeline:

Data cleaning & feature engineering

Modeling approach

Evaluation metrics

Visualization or dashboard design

Use a short numbered list or flow diagram.

Purpose: communicates your analytical process clearly.

🧠 5. Modeling & Evaluation

Explain the models you tested and how you compared them.

Include the evaluation metric (e.g., ROC-AUC, F1 score) and why it fits the business goal.

Include one or two visuals (confusion matrix, ROC curve, SHAP summary).

Purpose: shows rigor and justification, not just “accuracy = 85%”.

📈 6. Results & Insights

Summarize the key findings: what factors drive churn? what’s the actionable takeaway?

Use visuals or bullet points.

Keep it non-technical — focus on insight over code.

Purpose: demonstrates that you can translate technical work into business value.

🧰 7. Tech Stack

List key tools & libraries (Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Power BI, etc.).

Optionally show a small architecture diagram if you used cloud or pipelines.

Purpose: reinforces your tool versatility.

🔗 8. Dashboard / App / Blog Links

Add:

Power BI / Tableau dashboard URL

Streamlit app (if deployed)

Blog or Medium article

Dataset source

Purpose: makes your project interactive and credible.

🧩 9. Repository Structure

Include a simple file tree (use code block style):

.
├── data/
├── notebooks/
├── models/
├── dashboard/
├── README.md


Purpose: helps reviewers navigate quickly.

🧱 10. How to Reproduce

Short instructions to rerun the project:

Clone repo

Install requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Run notebooks in order

Optional: how to connect to dashboard / API

Purpose: shows professionalism and reproducibility.

💬 11. Future Work / Improvements

Mention what you’d expand or optimize if you had more time (new features, better models, MLOps automation).

Purpose: shows forward thinking and awareness of limits.

👤 12. Author / Contact Info

Your name, LinkedIn, portfolio site, and email.

Purpose: gives recruiters a clear next step.
